In this directory I show examples of code I have written for various active learning strategies. In AL_Classification.ipynb I wrote uncertainty sampling, density sampling, query by commitee, expected model change, and mellow uncertainty sampling for a logistic regression classifier on simulated data. In AL_Regression.ipynb I wrote similar stategies for a regressive model, linear regression. In AL_Meta_Diversity.ipynb I implemented diversity sampling, meta learning, and various additional flavors of uncertainty sampling for a logistic regression classifier.
