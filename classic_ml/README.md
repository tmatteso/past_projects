In this directory, I have many old projects from different machine learning courses. In Extreme_Feature_Selection.ipynb, I wrote a project that evaluated the performance of many classifiers on real world cancer transcriptomic data. I then used feature selection through various methods to go down from over 60,000 features down to 5, while barely losing performance. In HMM_FB_Vit.ipynb I wrote a Hidden Markov Model from scratch, trained it with forward-backward algorithm, and then used the Viterbi algorithm for inference. In ILP_algo.py, I wrote an Integer Linear Program to solve a Minimum Hitting Set problem on real world cancer minimum inhibitory concentration data. In K_means_EM.ipynb, I wrote K-means clustering from scratch and I trained with Expectation Maximization. In Log_Regression.ipynb, I wrote unpenalized linear regression, l-2 penalized regression, and l-1 penalized regression from scratch and trained it with gradient descent. In MLP.ipynb, I wrote a Multilayer Perceptron from scratch and trained it with gradient descent. In Momentum_SGD.ipynb, I wrote optimization algorithms for logisitic regression: implementing gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and each with momentum. In PageRank.py, I wrote various flavors of PageRank with sparse matrix representations on a large real world dataset.
