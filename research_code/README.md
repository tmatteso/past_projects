In this directory, I have an unfinished python library that was created for a summer research project. It is part of the same project as my other public repo, LargeSmall. The library was to be used to impute genotypes in mouse phylogenies given input pedigrees. Following this line of reasoning, the majority of the code is devoted to traversing the pedigreee tree and handling inheritance cases for haplotype phasing. This serves as an example of my writing of research code.
