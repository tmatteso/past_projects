In this directory I show old basic coding projects from an object oriented programming class I took during my bachelor's. In Blackjack.py, I coded a game of Blackjack to play with between 2 and 6 players. In Geom.py, I wrote a file that generates geometric objects from text inputs and a series of testing functions to ensure my code was functioning as expected. In Graph.py, I wrote a simple object oriented framework for graph algorithms. In Josephus.py, I wrote a program that handles the Josephus problem through linked lists. In Poker.py, I wrote a script that simulates a poker game. In TestBinaryTree.py, I wrote a simple object oriented framework for binary trees. In TestLinkedList.py, I wrote a script that tests out various functions on linked lists. In TopoSort.py, I wrote a program that evaluates an graph input and then performs topological sorting if the graph is acyclic.
