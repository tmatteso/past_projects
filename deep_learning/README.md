At present moment, this directory is full of deep learning image projects I've used for different classes. In BasicImageClassification.ipynb, I finetuned AlexNet and ResNet18 architectures pretrained on Imagenet on the PatchCamelyon breast cancer image dataset. In this project, I performed binary classifcation with respect to malignancy on 327680 H and E stained slide images. In the other three .py files I wrote a modified AlexNet architecture to produce convolutional embedding for me to examine by upscaling the output heatmaps. AlexNet.py describes the main architecture and a robust modification to improve performance. In heatmap.py, I train and evaluate both models on the voc image dataset. In voc_dataset.py, I wrote a few helper functions to add to the dataloader provided by the instructors, allowing me to collate images and proposed bounding boxes. In wsddn.py, I wrote an architecture for weakly supervised object detection.
