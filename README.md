# past_projects


This repo is full of old code, meant to be examples of my coding for others to look through. It includes coding_basics, where I have placed examples of projects I wrote for one of my first coding courses at UT Austin in 2018. The research_code directory is an unfinished Python library that was used as part of a Summer Research Project (connected to my other public repo LargeSmall), it serves as an example of the kind of code I've written for research. The classic_ml directory is a directory full of .py and .ipynb files where I wrote various classic machine learning algortihms from scratch for old courses. The active_learning directory is full of .ipynb files where I wrote algorithms for various active learning strategies from scratch. The deep_learning directory is full of pytorch code from past classes, as I cannot include any of my current coursework code (I asked my professors). After the end of the semester, there should be some more interesting projects commited here.
